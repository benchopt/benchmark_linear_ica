BenchOpt Benchmark for Linear ICA
=================================
|Build Status| |Python 3.6+|

BenchOpt is a package to simplify and make more transparent and
reproducible the comparisons of optimization algorithms.
This benchmark is dedicated to Independent Component Analysis (ICA):

.. math::

    X = A S

where X is n_features x n_samples, A is n_features x n_features and S
is n_features x n_samples. The purpose of ICA is to recover the
mixing matrix A from X.

Install
--------

This benchmark can be run using the following commands:

.. code-block::

   $ pip install -U benchopt
   $ git clone https://github.com/benchopt/benchmark_linear_ica
   $ benchopt run benchmark_linear_ica

Apart from the problem, options can be passed to `benchopt run`, to restrict the benchmarks to some solvers or datasets, e.g.:

.. code-block::

	$ benchopt run benchmark_linear_ica -s fastica -d simulated --max-runs 10 --n-repetitions 10


Use `benchopt run -h` for more details about these options, or visit https://benchopt.github.io/api.html.
